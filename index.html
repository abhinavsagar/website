              <p>Hi! I am a senior year undergraduate at VIT Vellore.
                 My research areas are bayesian deep learning, generative models, variational inference etc 
                 on the theoretical side and medical imaging, autonomous driving etc on the application side.
                 More broadly, I am interested in deep learning and computer vision with a bayesian approach taking uncertainty into account. 
                 The communities I follow closely are NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, MICCAI, UAI and JMLR.
              </p>
              <p>I spent the summer of 2019 in <a href="https://www.tessact.com/">Tessact</a> where I worked on product recommendation using variational autoencoders.
                 I spent the summer of 2018 in <a href="https://www.tatasteel.com/">Tata Steel</a> where I trained a neural network on power grid electricity consumption data to predict the load 24 hours ahead of the actual generation.
                 In my free time, I work on my own open source projects which can be found <a href="https://github.com/abhinavsagar">here</a>
                 and write blogs related to them which can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@abhinav.sagar">here</a>.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this work, we address the problem of blurred images which are often generated
using Variational Autoencoders and the problem of mode collapse in Generative
Adversarial Networks using a single model architecture. We use the encoder of
VAE as it is while replacing the decoder with a discriminator. The encoder is fed
data from a normal distribution while the generator is fed that from a gaussian
distribution. The combination from both is then fed to a discriminator which tells
whether the generated images are correct or not. We tested the model on 3 different
datasets increasing in complexity MNIST, fashion MNIST and TCIA Pancreas
CT dataset. On training the model for 300 iterations, it was able to generate
much sharper images as compared to those of VAEs. This work is potentially
very exciting as we are able to combine the advantages of generative models and
inference models in a bayesian approach. As there is a shortage of medical data,
this approach could be revolutionary given that we are able to reason from the
bayesian approach taking into account the uncertainty of generation.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Deep neural networks have been highly successful in image classification problems.
In this paper, we show how deep neural networks can be used for plant disease
recognition in the context of image classification. We have used a publicly available
Plant Village dataset which has 38 classes of diseases. Hence the problem that
we have addressed is a multi class classification problem. We have compared five
different architectures including VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, InceptionResNet
and DenseNet169 as the backbones for our work. We found that ResNet50 which
uses skip connections using a residual layer archives the best result on the test set.
For evaluating the results, we have used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score and class wise confusion metric. Our model achieves the best of results using
ResNet50 with accuracy of 0.982, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.94 and F1 score of
0.94.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> The goal of bayesian approach used in variational inference is to minimize the KL
divergence between variational distribution and unknown posterior distribution.
This is done by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). A neural network
is used to parametrize these distributions using Stochastic Gradient Descent. This
work extends the work done by others by deriving the variational inference models.
We show how SGD can be applied on bayesian neural networks by gradient
estimation techniques. For validation, we have tested our model on 5 UCI datasets
and the metrics chosen for evaluation are Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) error
and negative log likelihood. Our work considerably beats the previous state of the
art approaches for regression using bayesian neural networks.</p>

convolutional layers in downsampling layers and transposed convolutional layers
in the upsampling layers and used concat layers to merge them. We have used skip
connections in between alternate blocks which are comprised of convolutional and
max pooling layers. We present an in depth theoretical analysis of our network
with training and optimization details. We evaluated our network on the Camvid
dataset using mean accuracy per class and Intersection Over Union (IOU) as the
evaluation metrics on the test set. Our model outperforms previous state of the art
on semantic segmentation achieving mean IOU value of 74.12 while running at
>100 FPS.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this work, we address the problem of skin cancer classification using convolutional neural networks. A lot of cancer cases early on are misdiagnosed as
something else leading to severe consequences including the death of a patient.
Also there are cases in which patients have some other problems and doctors think
they might have skin cancer. This leads to unnecessary time and money spent for
further diagnosis. In this work, we address both of the above problems using deep
neural networks and transfer learning architecture. We have used publicly available
ISIC databases for both training and testing our model. Our work achieves an
accuracy of 0.935, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.77, F1 score of 0.85 and ROCAUC of 0.861 which is better than the previous state of the art approaches.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this work, we address the problem of 3D object detection from point cloud
data in real time. For autonomous vehicles to work, it is very important for the
perception component to detect the real world objects with both high accuracy and
fast inference. In this work, we propose a novel neural network architecture along
with the training and optimization details for detecting 3D objects in point cloud
data. We compared the results with different backbone architectures including the
standard ones like VGG, ResNet, Inception with our backbone. Also we present
the optimization and ablation studies including designing an efficient anchor. We
have used the Kitti 3D Bird’s Eye View dataset for benchmarking and validating
our results. Our work surpasses the state of the art in this domain both in terms of
average precision and speed running at > 30 FPS. This makes it a feasible option to
be deployed in real time applications including self driving cars.</p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Deep learning motivated by convolutional neural networks has been highly successful in a range of medical imaging problems like image classification, image
segmentation, image synthesis etc. However for validation and interpretability, not
only do we need the predictions made from the model but also how confident it is
while making those predictions. This is important in safety critical applications
for the people to accept it. In this work, we used an encoder decoder architecture
based on variational inference techniques for segmenting brain tumour images.
We compared different backbones architectures like U-Net, V-Net and FCN as
sampling data from the conditional distribution for the encoder. We validated our
work on BRATS dataset using Dice Similarity Coefficient and Intersection Over
Union as the evaluation metrics. Our model achieves state of the art results while
making use of a principled way of uncertainty quantification.</p>

              <p><b>Abstract:</b> Bayesian neural networks perform variational inference over weights but calculation of the posterior distribution remains a challenge. Our work builds on
variational inference techniques for bayesian neural networks using the original
Evidence Lower Bound. In this paper, we present a stochastic bayesian neural
network in which we maximize Evidence Lower Bound using a new objective
function which we name as Stochastic Evidence Lower Bound. We tested our
approach on 5 publicly available UCI datasets using test RMSE and log likelihood
as the evaluation metrics. We demonstrate that our work not only beats the previous
state of the art algorithms but also allows uncertainty quantification and is scalable
to larger datasets.</p>
